        <p>
          For over 8 years, <strong>Sandeep K D</strong> has been leading <strong>EVOLVE, Events and Promotions</strong>,
          a trusted event management company that partners with premium brands and organizations to deliver unique and memorable experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sandeep and his team specialize in fundraising event planning and, with help from a strong professional network,
          have organized many events that support charities and non-profit organizations. He believes in working only with the best —
          from photographers and designers to artists and promoters — so every event is managed with creativity, professionalism,
          and calm under pressure.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond EVOLVE, Sandeep is a marketing strategist and an experienced event planner, known for organising some of India’s most
          celebrated film award nights. He has contributed to major events like the Dubai Marathon, International Yoga Day in Mumbai,
          and the Thakare Foundation. He is also a founding member of The Spoke Club and the Young Patrons Council for the Royal Dubai Museum.
